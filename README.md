# React-PivotTable

This project is a React port of the jQuery-based [PivotTable.js](https://pivottable.js.org/) (by the same author) and is under active development, but it's early days and not production-ready yet.

## Demo

Work-in-progress demo is here: https://react-pivottable.js.org/

## Project Goals

* Similar API to PivotTable.js but more uniform
* ES6 instead of CoffeeScript
* React instead of jQuery
* Plotly.js instead of C3.js

## Roadmap to Release

* See [Issue #1](https://github.com/plotly/react-pivottable/issues/1)
